To test the visualization locally, you can use [`live-server`](https://tapiov.net/live-server/), and simply run it in the terminal.

> Note: A [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) also exists, but I haven't tested it myself.

Also, if you do not need live reloading, you can use the following command:

```bash
python -m http.server
```

All this options will create a local server that will allow you to see the visualization in your browser.
